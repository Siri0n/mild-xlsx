# mild-xlsx
Simple xlsx-processing library focused on not breaking anything.

Its use-case is when you just want to add some data into existing xlsx Workbook, and to preserve styles, forms, scripts and other stuff.

## Disclaimer

I'm writing this lib for my work needs. It means that mild-xlsx will contain only methods which I need, unless someone requests additional features. So feel free to do that :)

## Installation

NodeJS:
> npm install mild-xlsx

## API

I'm trying to mimic a MS COM Excel API. More info later.
