Simple xlsx-processing library focused on not breaking anything.

Its use-case is when you just want to add some data into existing xlsx Workbook, and to preserve styles, forms, scripts and other stuff.

# Installation

NodeJS:

**npm install mild-xlsx**

# API

I'm trying to mimic a MS COM Excel API. More info later.
